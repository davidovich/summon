Summon example data provider repo
=================================

This repository hosts a [{{ .SummonerName }}](https://github.com/davidovich/summon) data
provider.

You install this provider as `{{ .SummonerName }}` and then can use the `{{ .SummonerName }}` executable to
summon assets.

Using go get, you can provision every repo with versioned data, but managed in a
central fashion.
